Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, class, and more.

Project Overview

- Goal: Predict survival using classification algorithms
- Dataset: Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) or [DataScienceDojo GitHub](https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets)
- Tech Stack: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib

Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualizations (e.g., survival by gender)
